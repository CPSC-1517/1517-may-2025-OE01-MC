Project: Bus Class Implementation
Objective: Develop a Bus class in C# with specific properties, methods, and error handling, along with supporting xUnit tests using FluentAssertions.

Specifications:

Class Definition:
	The class should be named Bus.

Properties:
	string Route: Auto-implemented property with a private setter. Must not be null or empty.
	string BusNumber: Auto-implemented property with a private setter. Must not be null or empty.
	int Capacity: Auto-implemented property with a private setter. Must be greater than zero.
	double Fare: Auto-implemented property with a private setter. Must not be negative. Default value is 2.50.
	List<string> Stops: Auto-implemented property with a private setter. Must not be null.

Constructors:
	No default constructor.
	A greedy constructor that initializes Route, BusNumber, Capacity, and Fare (with a default value of 2.50). The Stops list should be initialized as an empty list.

Methods:
	void AddStop(string stop): Adds a stop to the Stops list. Throws an exception if the stop is null or empty.
	void RemoveStop(string stop): Removes a stop from the Stops list. Throws an exception if the stop is null or empty.
	override string ToString(): Returns a CSV string of the properties.

Error Handling:
	All properties should have appropriate error checking for null or negative values.

Test Cases:
	Test	Description											Expected Output
	TC01	Constructor initializes properties correctly		Properties set correctly, Stops list is empty
	TC02	Constructor throws exception for null Route			ArgumentException with message including "null or empty"
	TC03	Constructor throws exception for null BusNumber		ArgumentException with message including "null or empty"
	TC04	Constructor throws exception for zero Capacity		ArgumentException with message including "greater than zero"
	TC05	AddStop adds stop to list							Stops list contains 1 stop
	TC06	AddStop throws exception for null stop				ArgumentException with message including "null or empty"
	TC07	RemoveStop removes stop from list					Stops list does not contain "Stop1"
	TC08	RemoveStop throws exception for null stop			ArgumentException with message including "null or empty"
	TC09	ToString returns CSV format							"Route1,Bus100,50,2.5,Stop1;Stop2"
